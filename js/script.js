/* Create a lightbox for viewing full size images when their thumbnails are clicked. */

/* Add text captions to the images when viewed in the lightbox. */

/* Add back and forward buttons when the lightbox is visible to switch between photos. */

/* Implement the search box at the top of the page that filters photos based on the captions.
    The photos should filter in real-time as you type.
    This could be a jQuery plugin that you find on the web, or code that you write yourself. */
